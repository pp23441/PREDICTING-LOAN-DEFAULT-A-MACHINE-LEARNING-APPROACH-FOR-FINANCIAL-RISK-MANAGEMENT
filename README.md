# PREDICTING-LOAN-DEFAULT-A-MACHINE-LEARNING-APPROACH-FOR-FINANCIAL-RISK-MANAGEMENT
Default prediction for borrowers on the basis of supervised learning models by financial institutions simply became a crucial task being absolutely required to successfully deal with the risk issues.
Applying the risk assessment with more precision to determine when a borrower is likely to default, the lenders can be able to make wise decisions about loans and risk management. The mission of doing this naturally must be one of the important obligations of the organizations and to maintain a responsible lending practice in the institutions. This work is comprised of numerous machine learning models exploration with lendersâ€™ platform data exploitation to forecast loan default. Using the model, we intend to conduct in-depth analysis and model validation such that we are highly capable to come up with the most powerful predictive model for it.

# Model Implementation and Evaluation 


# Conclusion

Finally, this report examined the development of several machine learning models that can be used in predicting loans gone bad and demonstrated that a Neural Network was the strongest performing model. The default rate of a loan may be impacted by a number of things such as recovery efforts, collection fees, and interest rates. Usage of the correct methods of analysis, helps pin point the role of default so as to ensure that financial decisions are with precision. Model Neural Network turned out to be a more precise forecasting tool due to its unique capacity for selecting novel patterns in the data set. Through the application of sophisticated modeling techniques as well as a parameter monitoring comprehension, the financial institutions are able to implement better risk assessment practices and to make lending decision with fewer financial losses thus preserving financial lending procedures.
